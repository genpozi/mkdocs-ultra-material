research_question: |
  How do different AI agent frameworks compare in terms of code quality, autonomy, 
  integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness for software development tasks?

background: |
  The emergence of large language models has enabled a new generation of AI-powered 
  development tools. These range from simple code completion to fully autonomous agents 
  capable of understanding requirements, writing code, running tests, and iterating on 
  solutions. This research examines the current landscape of AI agent frameworks to 
  understand their capabilities, limitations, and optimal use cases.

executive_summary: |
  This research evaluates five major AI agent frameworks for software development: 
  AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer, MetaGPT, Devin, and Cursor. Our analysis reveals that while 
  all frameworks show promise, they excel in different areas. AutoGPT offers the most 
  flexibility but requires significant prompt engineering. GPT-Engineer provides the 
  best balance of autonomy and control for greenfield projects. MetaGPT excels at 
  multi-agent collaboration for complex systems. Devin shows superior code quality 
  but at a premium price point. Cursor offers the best IDE integration for existing 
  codebases.
  
  Key findings indicate that AI agents are most effective for well-defined tasks, 
  boilerplate generation, and documentation. They struggle with complex architectural 
  decisions, debugging subtle issues, and maintaining context over long sessions. 
  We recommend a hybrid approach where AI agents handle routine tasks while human 
  developers focus on high-level design and critical problem-solving.

recommendations:
  - "Start with IDE-integrated tools like Cursor for existing projects before adopting fully autonomous agents"
  - "Use AI agents for documentation generation and test writing to build confidence"
  - "Implement code review processes specifically designed for AI-generated code"
  - "Establish clear guidelines for when to use AI agents vs. traditional development"
  - "Monitor costs carefully as API usage can scale quickly with autonomous agents"
  - "Invest in prompt engineering training for development teams"
  - "Consider open-source alternatives for sensitive codebases"
