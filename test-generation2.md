## Introduction to Docker Containers
Docker containers are lightweight and portable execution environments that allow developers to package their applications and dependencies into a single container that can be run consistently across different environments. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other's dependencies or the host's configuration.

## Key Benefits and Use Cases
Docker containers provide several benefits, including faster deployment, easier rollback, and improved resource utilization. They are ideal for use cases such as development environments, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and microservices architecture. Containers can be easily created, started, stopped, and deleted as needed, making it simple to manage complex applications.

## Basic Docker Commands
To get started with Docker containers, you can use basic commands such as `docker run` to create and start a new container, `docker ps` to list running containers, and `docker stop` to stop a container. For example, to run a new container from the official Nginx image, you can use the command: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`. This command creates a new container from the Nginx image, maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container, and runs it in detached mode.
