## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Homelab Documentation Sprint

**Scenario**: You've been building your homelab for months but documentation is scattered.

**30-Minute Documentation Sprint**:

```bash
# 1. Overall architecture (5 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Document my homelab architecture with these services: \
   Traefik (reverse proxy), Portainer (container management), \
   Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring), Loki (logging), \
   Nextcloud (file storage), Vaultwarden (password manager). \
   Include network topology, service interactions, and data flow." \
  -o docs/homelab/architecture.md

# 2. Each service (3 min each = 18 min)
for service in traefik portainer prometheus grafana loki nextcloud; do
  mkdocs-ai generate \
    "Document my $service homelab service including purpose, \
     configuration, environment variables, volumes, networking, \
     and troubleshooting tips." \
    -o docs/services/$service.md
done

# 3. Backup strategy (5 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Document backup strategy for homelab services including \
   what's backed up, schedule, storage, and restore procedures." \
  -o docs/operations/backup.md

# 4. Quick reference (2 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Create quick reference guide for common homelab tasks: \
   restarting services, checking logs, updating containers, \
   and accessing services." \
  -o docs/quick-reference.md
```

**Result**: Complete homelab documentation in 30 minutes!

### Example 2: Research Deep Dive

**Scenario**: You're evaluating Kubernetes for your homelab.

**Research Documentation**:

```bash
# 1. Initial research (10 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Create comprehensive research report on Kubernetes for homelab use. \
   Include: what it is, benefits vs Docker Compose, resource requirements, \
   learning curve, management tools (k3s, k0s, microk8s), \
   and whether it's worth it for homelab." \
  -o docs/research/kubernetes-evaluation.md

# 2. Comparison (5 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Compare k3s vs k0s vs microk8s for homelab Kubernetes. \
   Include feature comparison, resource usage, ease of setup, \
   and recommendations." \
  -o docs/research/k8s-distributions.md

# 3. Migration plan (5 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Create migration plan from Docker Compose to Kubernetes for homelab. \
   Include: preparation steps, service-by-service migration strategy, \
   testing approach, rollback plan, and timeline." \
  -o docs/plans/k8s-migration.md

# 4. Learning path (5 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Create learning path for Kubernetes focusing on homelab use. \
   Include: concepts to learn, hands-on exercises, resources, \
   and estimated time commitment." \
  -o docs/learning/kubernetes-path.md
```

**Result**: Complete research documentation ready for decision-making!

### Example 3: Daily Knowledge Capture

**Scenario**: You solved a tricky problem and want to document it.

**Quick Capture**:

```bash
# Immediate capture (2 min)
mkdocs-ai generate \
  "Document the SSL certificate issue I just fixed with Traefik. \
   Problem: certificates weren't renewing automatically. \
   Cause: incorrect DNS challenge configuration. \
   Solution: updated docker-compose.yml with correct Cloudflare API token. \
   Include troubleshooting steps and prevention." \
  -o docs/troubleshooting/traefik-ssl-renewal.md

# Add to troubleshooting index
echo "- [Traefik SSL Renewal](traefik-ssl-renewal.md)" >> docs/troubleshooting/index.md
```

**Result**: Problem documented while fresh in your mind!

---

## Tips for Daily Use

### 1. Start Small

**Don't try to document everything at once**:
- Pick one area (e.g., homelab services)
- Document one thing per day
- Build documentation habit gradually

### 2. Use Templates

**Create templates for common documentation types**:
```bash
# Service documentation template
mkdocs-ai generate "..." -t .ai-templates/service-docs.md.j2

# Research template
mkdocs-ai generate "..." -t .ai-templates/research-report.md.j2

# Troubleshooting template
mkdocs-ai generate "..." -t .ai-templates/troubleshooting.md.j2
```

### 3. Batch Similar Tasks

**Document related things together**:
```bash
# All services at once
for service in service1 service2 service3; do
  mkdocs-ai generate "Document $service" -o docs/services/$service.md
done
```

### 4. Review and Refine

**AI generates drafts, you add the personal touch**:
1. Generate initial documentation
2. Review for accuracy
3. Add project-specific details
4. Include personal insights
5. Update as things change

### 5. Use Caching Wisely

**Balance freshness vs cost**:
```yaml
cache:
  ttl: 86400  # 24 hours for most content
  # Clear cache when you want fresh perspective
```

### 6. Organize by Purpose

**Structure your docs directory**:
```
docs/
├── daily/          # Daily notes and logs
├── research/       # Deep research reports
├── services/       # Service documentation
├── troubleshooting/# Problem solutions
├── learning/       # Learning notes
├── projects/       # Project documentation
└── quick/          # Quick captures
```

### 7. Make It Searchable

**Use consistent naming and structure**:
- Date prefixes: `2025-01-15-topic.md`
- Clear titles and headings
- Tags in frontmatter
- Cross-references between docs

### 8. Integrate with Your Tools

**Make documentation frictionless**:
- Shell aliases for common tasks
- IDE shortcuts
- Git hooks for automation
- CI/CD for team docs

### 9. Share and Collaborate

**Documentation is more valuable when shared**:
- Use MkDocs to build a site
- Share with team or community
- Get feedback and improve
- Contribute back

### 10. Iterate and Improve

**Documentation is never "done"**:
- Update as you learn more
- Refine prompts for better output
- Build your prompt library
- Share what works
